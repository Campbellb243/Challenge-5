I'm excited to share the results of my project, where I explored the effects of various treatments on tumor volume in mice. This project has been a journey filled with learning and discovery, and I owe a huge debt of gratitude to several key individuals who supported me along the way. First and foremost, a heartfelt thank you to my tutor for their unwavering guidance and patience. Their expertise and encouragement were instrumental in helping me navigate the intricacies of the project. I also want to express my appreciation to my instructor for their valuable insights and for fostering an environment conducive to exploration and growth. And of course, a special shoutout to my older brother for his constant encouragement and belief in my abilities. Your support has been the driving force behind my success. To all of you, thank you for being my rock and for making this project journey one to remember!
